# AI-Driven-Pneumonia-Detection-Model-Tensorflow
A TensorFlow-powered Neural Network designed to classify pneumonia cases using structured clinical data. It's addressing the global shortage of radiologists by automating pneumonia detection from clinical data. This project reduces diagnostic delays and information asymmetry, providing a standardized tool for high-accuracy medical screening.
